# Notes about optimal v4 running

The orignal "default" settings in `testconfig_v4.yml`

DAC optimization studies for current dacs (`idacs`) are currently being done using the `config_v4_none.yml` and `config_v4_all.yml` files.

These central configuration files run in HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE MODE (the `blres` value `DisHiDR == 0` ). The chip can also be run in HIGH GAIN MODE by disabling this value.
